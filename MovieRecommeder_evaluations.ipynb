    "This notebook is part of the project Movie Recommendation System. Basic functionality of this notebook is to perform the model evaluation in terms of hitrate and recall. This will be used for comparing different models such as Content Based Filtering Model, Collaborative Filtering Model, Hybrid Filtering Model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that this notebooks is reused from the code walkthrough session, and made the required changes as needed.\n",

    "Functionalities provided as part of ModelEvaluator class:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The class is instantiated with following data:<br>\n",
    "    a. Indexed movie metadata.<br>\n",
    "    b. indexed user rating dataset.(complete dataset)<br>\n",
    "    c. indexed user ratings train dataset.<br>\n",
    "    d. Indexed user ratings test dataset.<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. get_not_interacted_movie_sample():<br>\n",
    "    Input for this method are user id and sample size. This method is used to get a list of non interacted movies for a given user. Then it will get a random set of movies from the non interacted list. This random sample size is configurable, and it can be changed in config file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. verify_hit_top_n():<br>\n",
    "    This method accepts 'item_id' and list of recommendations and the max position to be considered for hit rate calculation (topn).<br>\n",
    "    For example if the input topn = 5, then it checks whether the give movieId is present in the first 5 movies as part of recommended items. If so it will give the index at which the given movie is present as part of the recommended list and indicate there is a hit at the topn.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. evaluate_model_for_user() - Accepts model, userId and maximum number of recommedations needed.<br>\n",
    "    a. Get the list of movies user has interacted in test dataset.<br>\n",
    "    b. Get the list of movies user has interacted in training dataset.<br>\n",
    "    c. Invoke item recommendation API on given model, with user id and item to ignore as the list of movies identified in step b<br>\n",
    "    d. Now for each interacted movie in test set, perform a hit rate at 5 and hit rate at 10 computation.<br>\n",
    "    e. Compute the recall@n = number of hits@n / number of movies interacted in trainset.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. evaluate_model()  - Accepts model, Name of the model (collaborative, content based  or hybrid) and maximum number of recommedations needed.<br>\n",
    "    a. This method will perform hit rate computation for every user in the test set by invoking evaluate_model_for_user().<br>\n",
    "    b. Compute global recall@n for the given model<br>"
